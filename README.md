# script_for_medical_certificates

## Description
Our company had the following process: twice a week it was necessary to send certain clients information about accepted and rejected medical certificates that drivers of client companies submitted to us so that their individual health parameters could be changed.
Typically the process went like this:
1. A colleague from my department asked our colleague from the product department to upload certificates on a certain day, indicating the necessary parameters in the letter -> 2. Next, our colleague from the product department manually uploaded certificates from the database, manually formatted the uploaded file and sent it back.
I automated this process, as a result of which my colleague, in order to upload certificates, only needed to Install ```Python```, specify the parameters for uploading and press one button, after which the required file with information on references appears on his computer in a matter of seconds.

My automation allowed:
1. Reduce the total time for uploading certificates
2. Stop errors that sometimes occurred when formatting manually (I created a template for this in ```Power Query```)

## How to run and get results:
Just run the executable file from the Releases section, and then import the output result into an ```Excel``` file with a ```Power query``` template.
